### 6. ‚úÖ SwagBucks Messaging (COMPLETED)

- Tournament fees
- Classroom supplies
- Technology and tools
- Gift cards

**Updated to clearly state SwagBucks redeemable for:**

- Accessories
- Promotional items
- Custom branded items from your store

**Files updated:**
- Homepage hero and rewards section
- FAQ page SwagBucks explanation
- Request store page
- SwagBucks tracker component
- All 5 blog posts

### 7. ‚úÖ SwagBucks Tracker Redesign (COMPLETED)
**Major UI Improvements:**
- Reduced vertical height by 60%+
- Removed redundant information (Total Sales, Total Earned, Total Redeemed, Earning Rate)
- Removed large circular balance display
- Removed "available for redemption" and "how it works" footer text

**New Clean Design:**
- Compact header with title and description
- Horizontal progress bar with current balance badge
- Next milestone target on right side
- 3-column grid layout for milestone cards
- Green checkmarks for unlocked milestones
- Pulse animation on current target
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout

**Fixed Loading Issues:**
- Added comprehensive error handling for Firebase initialization delays
- Added 2-second timeout fallback
- Set default balance values on error
- Graceful degradation if Firebase isn't available

### 8. ‚úÖ Tenant Database Structure (COMPLETED)
**Updated Tenant Type:**
- Added `postalCode` field (Canadian postal code format)
- Added `organizationLevel` field (Minor/Youth, High School, etc.)
- Enhanced field documentation with comments
- Store-request API now captures all form fields

**Documentation Created:**
- Complete field mapping (Form ‚Üí Database)
- Status flow diagram (Pending ‚Üí Active)
- Database collection strategy
- API endpoint documentation
- Validation rules

**All Fields Mapped:**
- Identity: teamName ‚Üí name, storeName, slug, subdomain
- Contact: contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone
- Location: city, province, postalCode
- Organization: teamType, organizationLevel, teamSize, expectedVolume, description
- Request: urgency, logoUrl, submittedAt, status, isActive
- Approval: approvedAt, approvedBy (set during approval)

### 9. ‚úÖ Approve Button Fixed (COMPLETED)
**Critical Fixes:**
1. **Collection Routing**: Changed query from `tenants` with status filter to `pendingTenants` collection
2. **Approval Flow**: Creates new document in `tenants` collection, copies all data, generates website, deletes from `pendingTenants`
3. **Rejection Flow**: Simply deletes from `pendingTenants` collection
4. **Date Display**: Fixed submittedAt display (was trying to access .seconds, now uses ISO string correctly)

**How It Works:**
```
Form Submit ‚Üí 'pendingTenants' collection
              ‚Üì
Admin Reviews ‚Üí /admin/tenants/pending
              ‚Üì
Approve ‚Üí Create in 'tenants' collection
       ‚Üí Generate default website
       ‚Üí Delete from 'pendingTenants'
       ‚Üí Store live at {subdomain}.swagstore.ca
```

## üöß In Progress Work

### Decline Function with Tabs (STARTED - NOT COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Create a proper decline workflow with separate Declined tab

**Started Work:**
- Added `declinedTenants` collection concept
- Started building tabbed interface (Pending / Declined)
- Began implementing `handleDecline` function to move tenants to declined collection

**What Was Being Added:**
```typescript
const handleDecline = async (tenant: Tenant) => {
  // Move to declinedTenants collection
  // Remove from pendingTenants collection
  // Add declinedAt timestamp
  // Add declinedBy admin ID
}
```

**Tabbed Interface Started:**
- Using Shadcn Tabs component
- Two tabs: "Pending Requests" and "Declined Requests"
- Separate queries for pending and declined tenants
- Badge counts for each tab

**‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS: NOT TESTED OR COMPLETED**
- Code was partially written but not fully integrated
- Build may have errors
- Needs testing and refinement
- Consider if we want declined tenants visible or just deleted

---

## Next Session Tasks

## Technical Debt

1. **TypeScript Warnings:** Some `useCollection` type mismatches (safe to ignore for now)
2. **Error Handling:** Consider adding more robust error boundaries
3. **Loading States:** Could add skeleton loaders for better UX
4. **Image Optimization:** Logo uploads could use compression
5. **Email Service:** Need to integrate for approval/decline notifications

---

## Known Issues

1. **Decline Tab Not Completed:** Started but not finished - needs decision on approach
2. **Build Status:** Last successful build before decline work started
3. **No Email Notifications:** Approvals/declines don't trigger emails yet
4. **No Admin Auth:** Anyone can access admin pages (need to add auth check)

---

## Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Check current status
npm run build

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Navigate to pending tenants
# Open: http://localhost:3000/admin/tenants/pending
```

**First Task:** Decide on decline strategy (keep in DB with tabs vs simple delete), then complete implementation.
